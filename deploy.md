# Deploying {{site.data.keyword.prodname_imas_short}} deployable architecture
{: #deploying-da}

You can deploy a deployable architecture from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog. You can choose among different deployment options, including with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} projects. [Learn about IaC deployments with projects](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-understanding-projects).
{: shortdesc}

## Deploying with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} projects
{: #maximo-application-suite-deploy-cloud}

To deploy the {{site.data.keyword.prodname_imas_full}} deployable architecture through the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog, follow these steps:

1. Make sure that you comply with the prerequisites in the [planning](/docs/maximo-application-suite?topic=maximo-application-suite-planning) topic.
1. Select the **Add to project** deployment type in **Deployment** options.
1. Create a project by entering the name of your project, description, and specify a configuration name. Select the same Region where the existing cluster is running.
1. Click Create.
   An existing project can be used by clicking **Add to existing** and then selecting the project and entering the configuration name.
   {: note}

1. Edit and validate the configuration:
   - Select your authentication method. You can use an existing secret in **Secrets Manager** or add your **API key** directly.
    For more information, see [Using an API key with secrets manager to authorize a project to deploy an architecure](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-authorize-project).
   1. Enter values for other required fields in the **Required** tab.
   1. Enter values for the fields in the **Optional** tab.
1. Save the configuration.
1. Click **Validate**. Validation takes a few minutes.
     {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} projects runs a Code Risk Analyzer scan that includes a supported set of Security and Compliance Center rules. Controls that are part of the deployable architecture and that are also supported by {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} projects are checked. Any extra controls that are not included in the list of supported Security and Compliance Center rules are not checked when you validate the configuration.
       If the validation fails because of the Code Risk Analyzer scan, you can troubleshoot the failure. Make sure validation completes and `Validation successful` message is displayed.
   - In the **Approval pending** section, enter `I approve` and click the **Approve** button.
1. Deploy the configuration. After you validate your configuration, you can deploy it to your target account.
   1. Review the input values and make any necessary changes.
   1. Click **Deploy**.
       Deploying the deployable architecture for {{site.data.keyword.prodname_imas_short}} can take around an hour. For {{site.data.keyword.prodname_imas_short}} Core + Manage, it can take around 4 to 5 hours.
       You are notified when the deployment is complete and with successful or failure message. In case of failure, refer the schematics log.
1. Review the outputs from the deployable architecture.
   - **pipeline_execution_status** : If installation pipeline is successful then > Successful message is shown here. If there is a failure in any of pipeline task then that failed task information will be shown here.
   - **maximo_admin_url** : The admin URL to the deployed offering is displayed here.
     Login credentials to this admin url can be found under **Workloads > Secrets** section on your {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} cluster. Search for `<instance_id>-credentials-superuser name` under **Secrets** section. For example, if you entered `inst1` as input value to **mas_instance_id input** field then search for `inst1-credentials-superuser name` under **Secrets** section.
